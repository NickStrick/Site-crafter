        "A college athlete turned coach, I have over 15 years of experience with baseball and 10 years with softball. While coaching at Geneva baseball and Wasco Diamond fast pitch softball, I had also been running private and team hitting lessons for the last 6 years for softball and baseball players of all ages. I believe hard work and discipline are crucial to growing a player and their game but not at the expense of losing what is most important to the game and that is having fun.
